    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "`DataArray` (`DataArrayInt` and `DataArrayDouble`) are used in MEDCoupling to store values as contiguous arrays in memory. Values are grouped by tuples, and each tuple has the same number of components. They form the basis of many operations performed in MEDCoupling. Therefore, it is important to know how to manipulate them effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "`DataArrayDouble` is often used for the direct manipulation of field values, as we will see later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "`DataArrayInt`, on the other hand, is used for the manipulation of cell and point identifiers."

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this exercise is to become familiar with manipulating `DataArray`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to create a mesh containing 4 adjacent squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"four_squares.svg\" style=\"width:300px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step consists in **creating a `DataArray`** (array), containing the coordinates of the nodes of a square, with a side length of $1$, centered at $(0, 0)$. The first component of the coordinate array is called `X` with the unit `m` (meter), and the 2nd component is called `Y` (same unit).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we construct the coordinates of the nodes of the four squares we want to obtain by **duplicating the coordinates** of the nodes of the original square, and then applying a **translation** to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is then necessary to **merge the duplicate nodes**, resulting from multiple duplications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, an **unstructured mesh** is created from the `DataArray` of nodes which has been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concepts covered in this exercise are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating an instance of `DataArrayDouble`\n",
    "- Displaying an instance of `DataArrayDouble` and invoking the `getValue()` method to convert it to a list \n",
    "- Using \"slice\" type notations such as `da[:,:]`\n",
    "- Learning about renumbering (old-2-new convention)\n",
    "- Invoking services such as `findCommonTuples()`\n",
    "- Creating a `UMesh` (unstructured mesh)"
